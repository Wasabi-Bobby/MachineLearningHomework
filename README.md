# MachineLearningHomework

# Problem five doesn't work at the moment, but every other problem does with around 85 percent accuracy

# Should just have to open up the collab and run all for each one
# DO NOT SET LEARNING RATE HIGHER THAN WHAT I HAVE, lower is fine though.
# Turns out overflow is a thing and I wasn't able to completely fix it, its especially bad in softmax numby implementation since the bias will increase too quickly. I think normalizing or limiting its change to a certain extent would make it possible to not overflow
