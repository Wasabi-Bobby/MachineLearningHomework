# MachineLearningHomework

# Problem five doesn't work at the moment, but every other problem does with around 85 percent accuracy.

# Should just have to open up the collab and run all for each one.
# Do not set learning rate higher than what I have, lower is fine though.
# Turns out overflow is a thing and I wasn't able to completely fix it, its especially bad in softmax numby implementation since the bias will increase too quickly. I think normalizing or limiting its change to a certain extent would make it possible to not overflow.
